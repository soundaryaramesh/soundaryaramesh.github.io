  Hey there! I'm Soundarya Ramesh, a first year graduate student of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal with a Bachelors in Information Technology in May 2018. My research interests revolve around IoT security.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

As you might have figured out by now, most research papers are hard to follow (read as boring). So, in this part of my webpage, I try to provide short blog articles explaining my research work (to be updated soon!). 

For now, I list my research projects, with the most recent one first. 


* **SoundUAV: Towards Delivery Drone Authentication via Acoustic Noise Fingerprinting** <br />


* **Neuro-Symbolic Execution: Augmenting Symbolic Execution with Neural Constraints**
