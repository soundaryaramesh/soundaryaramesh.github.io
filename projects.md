As you might have figured out by now, most research papers are hard to follow (read: boring). So, in this part of my webpage, I try to provide short blog articles explaining my research work without too much technical detail. The goal is bring out the main ideas in the paper and share some thoughts beyond those conveyed in the paper (to be updated soon!).

Below, I list my research projects and associated blog posts, with the most recent one first. 


* <u>Soundarya Ramesh</u>, Thomas Pathier, Jun Han. **SoundUAV: Towards Delivery Drone Authentication via Acoustic Noise Fingerprinting**.  <i>To appear in the Proceedings of 5<sup>th</sup> ACM Workshop on Micro Aerial Vehicle Networks, Systems, and Applications (DroNet '19)</i>
