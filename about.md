  I'm Soundarya Ramesh, a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal with a Bachelors in Information Technology in May'18. My research interest revolves around IoT security.

<!--Apart from research, I'm very interested in -->


In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
