  I'm Soundarya Ramesh, a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore under Assistant Professor [Jun Han](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~junhan/). My research interests revolve around the security and privacy of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

  I graduated with a Bachelors in Information Technology from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal in 2018. 

  Apart from computer science, I'm really passionate about learning Sanskrit and enjoy reading philosophical books.

  In my blog, I write on topics that catch my fancy, mostly related to computer science. I really look forward to comments/suggestions. So if you have any, please feel free to contact me on my e-mail. 

<!--Apart from research, I'm very interested in -->
