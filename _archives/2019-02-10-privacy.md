title: Is privacy really hyped today?
---
### What is privacy?
Privacy is an individual's right to keep certain information to herself. What people want to keep private is completely upto themselves and there is no rigid demarcation of the same. For instance, some consider their sexual orientation to be private information, while some others are fine with sharing that in public. In this blog post, I will discuss some of the serious repurcussions of internet penetration on our private lives.   

### What's the problem of today's internet with regards to privacy?
In the late 18th century, English philosopher Jeremy Benthem designed a building called _Panopticon_ that can let its authorities watch over all the inmates from the central "inspection house", without the inmates knowing whether they're being watched or not. This design has been an inspiration for several prisons around the world, including the Presidio Modelo Prison in Cuba, shown below. Although not everybody can be watched at the same time, the idea was that the prisoners out of fear of being surveilled, will always _adhere to rules_ of the prison.

Now why is this example relevant to user's privacy in the 21st century? In today's world, though we live in homes with secure locks and have passwords for all our e-mail and banking accounts, with all the Internet Of Things (IoT) devices and smartphones around, most of us are electronically naked. Passwords can protect us from hackers, but how about the websites that we trust our information with? Are they really trust-worthy? Most websites have third party ad-agencies that continuously monitor our activities over the internet to provide relevant ads. According to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/08/americans-check-their-phones-80-times-a-day-study/">study</a>, people check their phones around _80_ times a day on average, for keeping their close ones updated, to share pictures on social media, to get their daily dosage of news app and to check emails for work-related purposes. Now, imagine the existence of an authority that has access to all this information that one shares using her phone? And this situation is quite likely today, with the penetration of companies like Google into all facets of human activities from Gmail, Google Docs for work, to Google Home for assistance at homes. This kind of mass-tracking, may not sound as harsh as Panopticon, however it can leave an indelible mark on users' lives. 

### Why is this really a problem, when I have "nothing to hide"?
A general misconception amongst people is that, privacy really matters when only for those who involve themselves in criminal activites such as terrorism or espionage and some others like jounralists and activists who have strong anti-government opinions, and therefore only the "bad people" have to be worried. However, this is a completely flawed argument. If we have nothing to hide, why do we care so much about keeping our passwords secure and instead, just release them publicly? I'm sure none of us will do this, because though we think privacy doesn't matter to us, it very much does. 

A 1976 psychology experiment gives us some hints on how humans alter their behaviour when observed. Researchers perfomed the experiment with kids during a Halloween party. When kids came home seeking chocolates and gifts, people of the house asked the kids to take one chocolate each from the living area. In all cases, there was nobody in the living area when the kids collected their chocolates. In half of these houses, researchers placed a mirror in front of the chocolates, so that the kids could see their reflections while picking up the toffees. The results showed that the kids were more likely to take more than one chocolate when there was no mirror in the living area. This experiment concluded that humans are subconsciously sensitive to being watched upon, be it a video camera or a photograph of your mom or even a mirror and this makes us alter our behaviour.  

Being monitored and tracked as in today's world, will make people _conform_ to popular beliefs and try to do things that are _acceptable_. Right now we may not have any issues and might be comfortable with our leaders and so on, but this mass-tracking will keep us from voicing our opinion even when we are not okay with the situation. We may avoid following a certain political party on Twitter, we may not be connected to infamous people on social media and avoid participating in protests even if we want to, for the fear of being monitored and tracked. Whether we accept it or not, we all have something that we don't want to reveal. To put it differently, we are not going to be oblivious to the surveillence around us and behave just as we would without it. With such digital surveillance in place, we subconsciously modify the way we use the web in order to have a <i>clean digital profile</i>. This will slowly erode our right to freedom and leave us in a mental Panopticon, if you will.   

Two pithy sayings that capture this above message are -
<blockquote>
  <p> Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Those who do not move, do not notice their chains. </p>

### Social media websites are not all bad, but...
Social media websites have a lot of good things to offer, but we need to take their services with a pinch of salt. It is indeed quite scary to know the amount of information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook–Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">this</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-incredible-story-of-how-target-exposed-a-teen-girls-pregnancy-2012-2">this</a> and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-16/metadata-retention-privacy-phone-will-ockenden/6694152">this</a>) companies like Google and Facebook know about us. So, we need to be aware of the various ways in which we can be exploited and make sure we agree with the privacy policies of the companies running the applications that we use. Being aware of what we share on websites is also a good way to keep check on our digital footprint.
