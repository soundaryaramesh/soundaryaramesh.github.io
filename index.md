Hey there! 
<!-- <img src='../files/photo.jpg' style='float:top;width:80%;padding-left:15px'/> -->

I'm Soundarya Ramesh, a final year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg), working with [Prof. Jun Han](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~junhan/) and [Prof. Chan Mun Choon](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanmc/). I'm part of the [Cyber-Physical Systems and Security (CyPhy)](http://cyphy.kaist.ac.kr) as well as the [Communication and Internet Research Lab (CIRL)](https://www.cir.nus.edu.sg) research groups. 
My research interests are in sensor security, as well as in enabling novel applications through sensing in the presence of emerging devices (AR/VR, wearables). Prior to graduate school, I obtained my Bachelors' in Information Technology from [NITK, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in). 
<!-- revolve around novel applications of acoustic sensing, as well as sensor security. -->

#### I'm currently looking for full-time industry research positions and postdoc opportunities! Please reach out if there are any openings in the areas of sensor security, wearable sensing and health sensing.
