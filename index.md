 Hi there! 
<img src='../files/photoo.jpg' style='float:right;width:30%;padding-left:20px'/>

I'm Soundarya Ramesh, a fourth year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg), working with [Prof. Jun Han](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~junhan/) and [Prof. Chan Mun Choon](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanmc/). My research interests revolve around the security and privacy of cyber-physical systems.


  I graduated with a Bachelors' in Information Technology from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in) in 2018. 

<!--  Apart from computer science, I really enjoy discussing different philosophical viewpoints and reading non-fiction. 

  In my blog, I write on topics that catch my fancy, mostly related to computer science. Feel free to share your thoughts on my posts and I'm open to suggestions. -->
