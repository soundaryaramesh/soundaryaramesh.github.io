title: A "Vim"sical beginning
---

It's been three years since I began my journey with Vim. It started more as a personal challenge to master it as this was one of those things that was known to have a steep learning curve. I still have a long way from mastering it, but learning it has been a challenging and fun exercise. In this post, I share some of the features that I enjoyed learning about Vim and some of which make it stand out in comparison to other editors. I am, however, not of the opinion that Vim is the best editor for every programmer, but it's definitely my preference. 

VIM, which stands for Visual IMproved, is a command-line editor, originally written by Bill Joy for BSD Unix in 1976. It is highly configurable, easily integrable with compiler tools, open-source and comparatively light-weight. Vim is also one of the most widely used text editors among developers even today. The reason for this, apart from the reasons above, is that Vim is very efficient as it eliminates the latency caused due to the usage of mouse and meta-keys. 

### Vim Fundamentals
Vim is a modal-editor, i.e., it operates in two modes; *Insert Mode*, where keystrokes are typed into the document and *Normal Mode*, where the keystrokes are interpreted as commands that act on the contents of the file. This feature has its advantages, as unlike non-modal editors which have to rely on meta keys for editing, vim is not restricted in the number of keyboard bindings it can have for the same. The default mode on opening Vim is the normal mode (or command mode). You will know you are in Insert mode when the bottom left of your screen has the words ``-- INSERT --``. The figure above shows how to switch back and forth between the two modes.

Two commands, in addition to the ones shown in the above figure that one ought to know are ``:wq`` for _save and quit_ and ``:q!`` to _quit without saving_. 

Now that we know some fundamentals, let's see some of Vim's cool features!

### Undo Tree
Try the following exercise in your favourite editor: type a word in a new document, undo the whole word and type a different word in its place. Now, try to recover the first word that you typed. Wondering how something so simple doesn't work? This is because most editors use a stack-based implementation of the undo functionality, unlike Vim that uses the tree data-structure.

<center><i>An example to understand the undo-redo operations in editors. <br/> In Vim, cc : Replace the whole line, u : undo latest changes.</i></center>
<br />
To understand this, consider the series of changes shown in the figure above. Here, a sentence _Original text_ is written and undergoes two replacements, one undo operation and two replacements, in that order. 


![image](images/vim_undo.png)
<center><i>An example to understand the undo-redo operations in editors. <br /> To the left: Tree-based Undo in Vim, To the right: Stack-based Undo</i></center>
<br />
Let us now see how these changes affect the undo-redo stacks with the help of the figure on the right, above. Initially, only the original text is in the undo stack. On making two successive replacements, the two modified texts, _Text-1_ and _Text-2_ get pushed onto the stack, while the redo stack remains empty. Note that the element on the top of the undo-stack is the one that is displayed on the user's screen. The next operation performed is Undo, after which the topmost element of the Undo stack is popped and this element is pushed onto the Redo stack. Till this point, both Vim-based undo tree as well as the stack-based undo exhibit identical behavior. However, now when the _Text-1_ is replaced by _Text-3_, in the stack-based approach, the undo stack pushes _Text-3_ into the stack, while the redo-stack pops all its elements as there is nothing to "redo" beyond this point. This causes the loss of the element _Text-2_ as it is neither part of the undo nor the redo stack from this point. Vim solves this problem by creating a new branch, constituted by the edges $1,4,5$ when the changes happen, as shown in the figure on the left, above.

In order to view the two branches in Vim, type the command ``:undolist`` in Normal mode. This displays the available branches for the current file. For the above example, the output of undolist is as shown below.

<br />
Here, *number* indictes the identifier of the branch, *changes* indicates the number of nodes in a given branch, *when* indicates the time when the last change was made and *saved* indicates how many times the file was saved in the branch. Now, in order to move to the branch containing *Text-2*, type the command ``:undo 3``, where $3$ indicates the branch ID.
<!---### Recording Macros
As kids, most of us would have been fascinated by the _"apply a formula to a column feature"_ in Microsoft Excel. Macros in Vim are exactly like that, but for text instead of numbers. Say suppose you have a CSV file with the name in the first column written as ` Firstname``<space>``Lastname `. If you want to convert all the names into small-case and remove the space between them, all you have to do is do the action for the first row, record it and apply it to all other rows. This is realisable with a total of three simple commands. This action can be stored in a buffer and can be re-used anytime before closing the file. It can come handy to programmers when a data file has to be converted into a Python dictionary.-->

###  Composability and Homogeneity
There are plenty of commands in Vim. However, just knowing a handful of them can help realise complex functionalities because they *compose* well with each other. For example, in normal mode, `/word` moves to the next occurrence of the _word_. When this is combined with a command `d` which deletes from the current cursor position, i.e., when we type `d/word`, Vim deletes from the current cursor position till the next occurrence of the word. This property where multiple commands work well in unison is what I term *composability* and it is commonplace in Vim. As a programmer, one can immediately think of instances where this can be applied. For example, we can use this to delete all contents of a function block till the closing braces, copy the contents of an array from the cursor position till the beginning of the array, indicated by opening square brackets and so on. 

The other powerful feature is the ability to easily repeat an action multiple times. For example, we know that ``i`` is the command to insert text. Now, what if we want to add a certain text 10 times? We simply change the command to ``10i``. This produces an output which is the output of the original command repeated $10$ times. I call this property *homogeneity*, inspired by the homogenous functions in mathematics, wherein if the input increases by a factor of $k$, so does the output. Homogeneity property can be readily useful if you want to paste a certain block of code several times or want to delete the next $6$ lines and so on. 

### Multiple Copy Buffers
Vim supports upto $26$ registers (one corresponding to each alphabet) which act as buffers that can store copied data and multiple of these can be populated at the same time. For instance, in order to copy the current line into the named register *a*, one types the command ``"ayy``, where ``"a`` specifies the register to be used and``yy`` is the command to copy the current line. One can also append data to this register by using the capital letter *A*, instead of *a*. Similarly, to paste the contents, we type ``"ap`` in normal mode. In constrast, most editors can store only the most recently copied item in the copy buffer. 
This feature in Vim can be useful when multiple parts of a code need to be copied and written into various other files.   

### Commonly used Commands
In the table below, I list a few commands that I often use in Vim. If you're a Vim user, feel free to share yours in the comments section below!

| Col1             | Col2     |
| :----------:     | :------: |
| . 		       | Repeat the previous command          |
| \*		       | Search for the word under the cursor |
| :n1		       | Go to the line number n1			  |
| :n1,n2>          | Right shift all the lines from n1 to n2 by tab space |
| daw		       | Delete a word under the cursor       |
| di" (or di{)     | Delete all contents within a pair of quotes (braces) |
| :.,.+4s/find/repl/g     | Replace all strings *find* with *repl* in $5$ lines from the current line |
